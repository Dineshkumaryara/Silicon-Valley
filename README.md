# Content Recommendation Strategy

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation details for enhancing the content recommendation algorithm of a leading social media platform. The solution focuses on user behavior analysis, algorithm performance, content diversity, and bias mitigation.

## Components
1. **Data Pipeline**: Real-time data ingestion and processing using Apache Spark and Kafka.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Training and deployment of the recommendation model using TensorFlow.
3. **Real-Time Recommendation System**: Real-time content recommendation using Kafka.
4. **Diversity and Bias Mitigation**: Ensuring diverse and unbiased content recommendations.
5. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Tracking algorithm performance and ensuring fairness.

## Setup
1. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Configure Kafka and Spark.

3. Run the data pipeline:
    ```bash
    python data_pipeline.py
    ```

4. Train the machine learning model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

5. Start the recommendation system:
    ```bash
    python recommendation_system.py
    ```

6. Ensure diversity and mitigate bias:
    ```bash
    python diversity_bias.py
    ```

7. Monitor the system:
    ```bash
    python monitoring.py
    ```
